# Realtime segmentation

The goal of this package is write a achieve a production grade cell segmentation service that can be deployed anywhere easily.

A lot of the code in the segmentation directory will be from the vector field segmentation repository at [https://github.com/ryanirl/torchvf](https://github.com/ryanirl/torchvf). It is a very well done repo, I only made small changes.
